## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this exercise I learned about hosting custom fonts locally, CSS variables, and making components of a page adjust to the users screen size.

### Continued development

I would like to continue work on the mobile version of this page. I see in the original design images, the article image is cropped and given a new aspect ratio for smaller screen sizes. In my solution, I simply scaled the image down, keeping the original aspect ratio.

I would also like to learn more about things such as media queries, vw/vh units, and other ways to make a web page more responsive using just CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Viewport Sized Typography](https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/) - I didn't end up using this in the end, but this was an interesting read on a simple way to make text responsive.
- [Using CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascading_variables/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This was a great way to define a color palette that I could use throughout the entire project.
- [Hosting Fonts Locally](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Web_fonts) - I've always linked my fonts on all the web pages I've built, so learning how to host them locally from a file was nice.
